                                    Governments are major advertisers in many countries, yet little is known about how they allocate discretionary advertising and whether these allocations distort media markets. Using administrative data on federal government advertising in Mexico from 2014–2022, I show that governments systematically favor ideologically aligned outlets. Exploiting the 2018 transition from right-wing to left-wing administration, I find that aligned outlets are 19.7 percentage points more likely to receive advertising. This preferential treatment persists even when comparing campaigns with identical target audiences, indicating favoritism beyond communication goals. Governments also pay price premiums to aligned outlets, both relative to market rates and above the cost-efficient benchmark for reaching target audiences. I quantify the trade-off between reaching target audiences and rewarding aligned outlets. Ideological misalignment reduces the probability of receiving advertising by 7.7 percentage points, while audience similarity increases it by 23.4 percentage points, revealing the government's willingness to sacrifice efficiency for partisan media. These allocations have significant downstream effects in the media market: aligned outlets expand newsroom capacity by 23\% and article production by 21\%, while misaligned outlets—particularly those dependent on government advertising—contract substantially. This represents a novel mechanism of media capture in competitive markets, where governments reshape the information environment through selective subsidization rather than direct censorship or explicit favor exchange.
